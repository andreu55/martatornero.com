## {{ page.title }}

Everything within you seeks your well-being, even the most (self-)destructive parts.

Old patterns, family burdens, limiting beliefs, inner conflicts, blockages... reveal fragments of the ego that have not been brought into the light of the **Self** and integrated.

Perhaps you've had the experience of connecting with your **Self**. That essence in you that remains calm in the midst of the storm and is capable of responding with incredible creativity, courage, and compassion.

That **Self** is in all of us, always. It has never been harmed, it has never left. It is the source of your inner leadership. It is what regenerates all wounds.

In therapy, I accompany you to identify and clear the veils that hide your **Self**, the clouds that cover the sun, and to activate its power to heal the relationship with your **Parts**.

### Parts? Yes, Parts.

**Parts** are the subpersonalities that make up your ego. The nature of the mind is multiple, and each Part brings gifts and talents. But also, at times, burdens. Burdens that arise, almost always, from our early years of life, when we didn't have the same tools we have now. Those burdens still weigh us down. And there are burdens that are not even ours, that come from our family system, society, or even past lives.

The good news is that burdens can be released, no matter where they come from or how heavy they are.

And when they are released, magic happens. Wounded children regain their vitality. Protectors relax. Inner critics become allies. Darkness reveals its hidden treasures.

Incredible but true. I've seen it enough times to believe with all my heart that anyone can heal.

**Healing oneself.** As a therapist, I won't tell you what to do, what to think, or how to relate to your inner world. Only *you* know that.

And by *you*, I mean your ***Self***.

My job is to accompany you, lantern in hand, through your inner landscapes, and to remind you when everything darkens that your own light is always shining.

My tools are Internal Family Systems, Jungian active imagination, and energy practices from Celtic and Tantric traditions.

I propose a profound personal and spiritual work. A transformation of your relationship with yourself that involves embracing all your **Parts**, even and especially the most difficult ones.

Knowing your harmful patterns is very good, but if you truly seek to change them in an integral and lasting way, you need to love *everything* within you. It's paradoxical, I know, but when you experience it, it will make a lot of sense.

The ultimate goal is for you to place yourself, your **Self**, at the center of your system, leading your **Parts** with compassion and effectiveness. Your healed **Parts** will trust you more, and usual triggers will activate them less, but when they do and anger, frustration, or sadness arise... you will be there to embrace yourself internally and regain inner peace.

You should know that this work does not offer immediate solutions. It requires time, commitment, and honesty with yourself. What I offer is a radically different way of relating than we've been taught, a way that embraces instead of rejects, that understands instead of judges, that integrates instead of segregates. A regenerative way.

It will be an honor for me to accompany you on the journey back to yourself.

### Some practical questions

<div class="acordeon-container">
  <div class="acordeon-item">
    <button class="acordeon-question">What problems is this therapy indicated for?</button>
    <div class="acordeon-answer">
      <p>I can't think of anything it can't help with, honestly. I could give you a list of the typical "problems" of our era (anxiety, depression, creative block, lack of meaning and purpose, addictive patterns, toxic relationships...), but all these problems are actually symptoms of something bigger: inner disconnection. By resolving this disconnection, Part by Part, everything can potentially be resolved.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="acordeon-item">
    <button class="acordeon-question">What is a session like?</button>
    <div class="acordeon-answer">
      <p>We connect via Google Meet (or in person, if we've had the pleasure of being in the same space) and I guide you in a brief practice to observe what manifests in you. If there's a specific purpose for the session, we address it; if not, we let ourselves be guided by the wisdom of your inner self.</p>
      <p>I will guide you through questions with which we seek to understand in depth the Parts that have emerged and for you to find your own Self, which is the true engine of regeneration. Over time, some Parts will be ready to release their burdens, and I will accompany you in the process of releasing them and bringing into that empty, fertile space the treasure they held within.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="acordeon-item">
    <button class="acordeon-question">And what happens after the session?</button>
    <div class="acordeon-answer">
      <p>Immediately after the session, my recommendation is that you write down on paper what has emerged for you as a way of integration.</p>
      <p>Between sessions, you can do integration work that will speed up the process. It's not necessary, but if you feel like it and can do it, you'll see that it's very beneficial.</p>
      <p>I will also offer you, according to your needs, different practices (journaling exercises, meditation, or active imagination) to further promote the energy of your Self in your daily life.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="acordeon-item">
    <button class="acordeon-question">How many sessions do I need?</button>
    <div class="acordeon-answer">
      <p>My recommendation is that you allow yourself to explore this new model for at least four sessions. This is usually how long it takes to open up to this new model.</p>
      <p>As for how long it might take to resolve a particular issue, you'll see that when you pull on a thread, many other Parts and burdens that were also entangled emerge. The good news is that the reverse is also true: everything you heal in one part of your system will have positive repercussions on other things that we might not even have seen in therapy sessions. Everything is interconnected.</p>
