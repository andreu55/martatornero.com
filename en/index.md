## Hello, I'm Marta Tornero! 🧙‍♀️✨

### I am an agent of regeneration, both outer 🌍 and inner 🧘‍♀️.

My life purpose isn't a single thing, and I've stopped trying to make it so. I suspect it's like this for many people. Our gifts and talents are multiple, because we ourselves are multiple.

What I do is work on ecosystem regeneration with syntropic agriculture 🌳 (I share about it, along with my husband, at [Permaprendices](http://www.permaprendices.com)) and I accompany people in the regeneration of their inner ecosystem.

Oh, and I'm also a fantasy writer 📖🦄, though this facet is still a work in progress.

Here you will find my work on inner regeneration, the therapeutic support I offer, and resources for you to learn to connect with your **Self** 💫 and integrate all the **Parts** 🎭 that make you up.

I accompany people to rediscover the wisdom, resilience, and inexhaustible abundance of their own inner system using Internal Family Systems (IFS), Jungian active imagination, and energy practices from Tantric and Celtic traditions *🧭*.

I believe in human beings. In all human beings. Beneath the veils of the ego, there is an inextinguishable light common to all 🌟. My mission is to help you see it.

I also believe in each person's capacity to accompany themselves. I develop practices to help you delve into your inner world 🪐 and discover its beauty and mystery🕯️.

On the blog, you'll find [*Resources*](/blog/categories/resources/) 📚 for self-therapy and peer therapy based on IFS and energy work from various spiritual traditions.

You can follow my work in my newsletter [*Interstices*](/link-to-newsletter/) 🌀🔮, where I share my own personal process, full of quirks and synchronicities.

<!-- "Intersticios" translates well to "Interstices". If you prefer to keep the Spanish name for branding, feel free. -->
